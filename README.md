Files:
Naomi.txt - List of ROMs that I tested on the RaspBerry Pi 4 4g, contains a working check, the ROM name, the actual name of the game and any notes
cmdline.txt - A customized cmdline.txt that does a direct boot with nothing else shown on the screen during launch
config.txt - The config.txt that I was using for this (generic 1080p display over HDMI)
naomiboot - An example of a direct boot for a setup as a single game unit

This project was proposed to me by someone who was looking to run a dedicated Marvel VS. Capcom 2 arcade machine.  They were not interested in having the RetroPie frontend.  This is a simple example of how you can run a dedicated machine by installing RetroPie fronend and replacing the EmulationStation startup with a dedicated game.  As seen in the naomiboot file, you can replace the current game with any game you want to have directly launch.
